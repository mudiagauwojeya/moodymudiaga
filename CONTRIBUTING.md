## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [mudiaga.dev@gmail.com](mailto:mudiaga.dev@gmail.com).

## How can one contribute?

Reporting bugs, suggesting enhancements, providing your thoughts on pull requests and open issues, and contributing code through Pull Requests are all great ways to contribute to this repository.

### Reporting a Bug

Issues are used to track bugs with this site. If you notice a bug when using the website, please [file an issue](https://github.com/uwojeyamudiaga/moodymudiaga) using the bug template. The template includes prompts for relevant information useful in debugging the issue. There's no need to identify the root cause or commit to opening a Pull Request with a fix. Simply reporting the bug is very useful and appreciated!

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements to this website are welcome. Feel free to discuss mail me [mudiaga.dev@gmail.com](mailto:mudiaga.dev@gmail.com).

For enhancements of all sizes, a Github Issue should exist. If you have an idea that you would like to share, consider [file an issue](https://github.com/uwojeyamudiaga/moodymudiaga) using the Feature template. This includes prompts for relevant information that can help with prioritizing and clarifying your idea and rationale.

### Commenting on Issues and Pull Requests

Sharing your opinions on open issues and pull requests, regardless of your experience level, is helpful to us as we develop this site. Diverse opinions and questions can uncover issues and spark conversation that results in improvements and learning that wouldn't happen without those comments.

### Contributing Code

Before contributing code, identify the Github issue that this code is related to. If an issue doesn't exist yet, please file an issue for it to provide more context to the portfolio team about what you are interested in changing. This can start conversation and save you time implementing something that may not be accepted by the portfolio team. If an issue already exists, feel free to contribute code to resolve it. 

**Note:** The [good first issue](https://github.com/uwojeyamudiaga/moodymudiaga) label is applied to simpler issues that do not require previous experience or knowledge to tackle.

## OVERVIEW

This website will serve as my portfolio website. However, rather than the typical portfolio website, I will use it to advertise my services as a freelance frontend developer. The technologies I am using are - `HTML`, `CSS`, `Sass/Scss` and `JavaScript` in a nodejs environment.

<br>
<br>

## PAGES

This website will have three pages, namely: Home, Projects, and Blog. The Home page will serve as the index or entry-point to the website. It will be more lengthy because it will sell me as a freelance frontend developer. The Project page as the name implies is meant to display completed and ongoing projects. Finally, the Blog page will serve as a blog when I integrate backend.

<br>
<br>

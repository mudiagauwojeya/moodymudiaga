## OVERVIEW

This website will serve as my portfolio website. However, rather than the typical portfolio website, I will use it to advertise my services as a freelance frontend developer. The technologies I am using are - HTML, CSS and Sass/Scss in a nodejs environment.

<br>
<br>

## FEATURES

The website features a call-to-action button on the hero section.

<br>
<br>

## PAGES

This website will have three pages, namely: Home, Projects, and Blog. The Home page will serve as the index or entry-point to the website. It will be more lengthy because it will sell me as a freelance frontend developer. The Project page as the name implies is meant to display completed and ongoing projects. Finally, the Blog page will serve as a blog when I integrate backend.

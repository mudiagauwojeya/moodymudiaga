## OVERVIEW

This website will serve as my portfolio website. However, rather than just the typical resume portfolio website, I will use it as a freelance fullstack developer. The technologies I am using are - `HTML`, `CSS`, `Sass/Scss`, `JavaScript`, `Nextjs`, and `Reactjs`.

<br>
<br>

## PAGES

This website has three pages, namely: Home, Projects, and Blog. The Home page serve as the index or entry-point to the website to introduce myself and services. The Project page as the name implies is meant to display completed and ongoing projects, that I worked on or contributed to. Finally, the Blog page will serve as a blog when I integrate backend.

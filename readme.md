# This is the official website of Mudiaga Moody Uwojeya.

Using the *mobile-first approach,* I am going to build this project from ground up
and improve it gradually. Firstly, I will focus only on the frontend. Thereafter, I will
work on the backend.

This project is going to serve as my portfolio as a freelance web developer. I will acquire
the skills I need to complete the project along the way. For instance, I am going to take SEO and UI/UX
courses. 

The technologies I am using are - sass/scss and nodejs.
